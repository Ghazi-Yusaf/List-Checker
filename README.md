# List-Checker
Compares values in list to user input, using fuzzywuzzy's WRatio method to find matches.

TO-DO

List delimiter - Currently only accepts comma delimited data, update for other delimiters

Space delimiter - Much more difficult, for non-delimited lists, would probably require seperate protocol, wouldn't be able to spot phrase breaks

Hyperlink support - insert URL as user input and pull ingredient data directly

Word match - Display token matches between inputs and list for more detailed user analysis

Updated UI - Remove terminal UI? Or develop more in depth terminal UI that allows for more user options

Speed-up - enhance the finding process speed, could use python-Levenshtein or more streamlined code

Edit list input directly - Allow user to edit the list directly from the console command line

Add mutliple lists - Create a system for multiple lists, allowing users to choose which lists to search through

User history - Save user searches with query to a database, allow user look-up and create white and blacklist

Editable user outputs - Create output lists that user can access and readily manipulate from the UI

More to-dos to come
